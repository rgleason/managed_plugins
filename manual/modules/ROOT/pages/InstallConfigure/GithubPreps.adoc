= Github OpenCPN/plugins fork

The builders need the information generated here.

As well as creating tarball and metadata files in Cloudsmith a link
with link:https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins[OpenCPN/plugins] is needed.
Make a fork of this repository in your own Github repositories.

To permit the builders to push to this repository the  environment variables
GIT_REPO and GIT_KEY_PASSWORD are needed for the services. A ssh key
authorises the connection with Github.

== Providing the link to your OpenCPN/plugins fork

Run steps 3-7 in the
xref::InstallConfigure/Catalog-Github-Integration.adoc#new-credentials[
Metadata Push Page].
Eventually, this ends up in a SSH-based url and
a password. These are used to set GIT_REPO and GIT_KEY_PASSWORD
